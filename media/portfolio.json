(The general differential equations are not analytically solvable.) However, we can make a numerical approximation. This simulation allows for multiple bodies with different starting position and velocities and varying masses. It includes a tracking feature based on the distribution of mass. Try finding a stable solution (it's really difficult)!",

Stippling uses small circles with varying position and diameter to produce the image, sometimes with variation in color. This implementation is adapted from Mike Bostock's <a href='https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/voronoi-stippling'>Voronoi Stippling</a> on Observable HQ, which uses Lloyd's Relaxation. Changes include converting from Observable's notebook to vanilla JavaScript, color weighting for the calculation of Voronoi Diagrams, and variable-width color stippling.",
